I'm a 2nd year Ph.D student at Computer Science & Engineering Department, University of California San Diego, where I am honored to be advised by Prof. [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/). I received my Bachelor degree at Department of Physics, Peking University, where I am fortunate to be advised Prof. [He Wang](https://hughw19.github.io/). 

My research interest lies broadly in 3D computer vision (especially perception) and Robotics Manipulation.
